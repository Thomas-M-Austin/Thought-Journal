# CBT Thought Journal

## Description
This project contains two Python scripts for a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Thought Journal. These tools help users identify and challenge negative thoughts, providing a structured approach to cognitive restructuring.

## Scripts

### 1. cbt_journal_terminal.py
This script provides a CBT thought journaling experience that only outputs to the terminal and does not store any information.

### 2. cbt_journal_with_csv.py
This script offers the same CBT thought journaling experience but with an additional option to save entries to a CSV file.

## Features
- Guided prompts for CBT thought journaling
- Pretty formatting for terminal output
- Option to save entries to a CSV file (in cbt_journal_with_csv.py)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the scripts.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

### For Terminal-Only Version (cbt_journal_terminal.py)
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script: python cbt_journal_terminal.py
4. Follow the prompts to complete your thought journal entry.
5. Review your entry in the terminal output.
6. For CSV-Saving Version (cbt_journal_with_csv.py)
7. Open a terminal or command prompt.
8. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
9. Run the script:python cbt_journal_with_csv.py
10. Follow the prompts to complete your thought journal entry.
11. Review your entry in the terminal output.
12. Choose whether to save the entry to a CSV file when prompted.

### CSV File
If using cbt_journal_with_csv.py, entries are saved to cbt_journal_entries.csv in the same directory as the script.
Each entry is appended as a new row in the CSV file.
The CSV file includes headers for each column.
Privacy Note
The terminal-only version (cbt_journal_terminal.py) does not store any information.
The CSV-saving version (cbt_journal_with_csv.py) stores entries locally in a CSV file if the user chooses to save them.

## Customization
You can modify the scripts to add more prompts, change the formatting, or adjust the CSV saving functionality as needed.
